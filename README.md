# Vaadin Bmi Calculator
Small Vaadin web app that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person.
The program originates from an 1/2 hour live-hack session during a workshop, to demonstrate how quickly you can come up with a working web app from scratch using Vaadin.

It includes
- binding data of a JavaBean (POJO) to the UI Form
- Bean Validation (with hibernate-validator)
